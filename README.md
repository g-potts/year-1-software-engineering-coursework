This coursework was part of our second module about object-oriented programming in Java.\
The task was to create a system that models and analyses an existing database, which represents a hypothetical movie rental company. Given four different tasks and an entity relationship diagram, we had to represent the database with class objects and analyse the results to return the required results.\
We had to create our own JTests to test the results of the program against the expected output. This helped to find what fields need to be tested, for example. names or addresses given in the correct format, or the correct answer being returned.\
We also represented each of our solutions using UML diagrams, UML sequence diagrams, or with personas, to show how each of our classes interact or the use cases for each function.\
The general functionality was that a class would make a generalised query to the database, for example to get a list of all customers, and create objects to represent them. It would then filter or sort based on the given requirement, like sorting by number of rentals made or selecting people who live in a certain country, then return the result.
